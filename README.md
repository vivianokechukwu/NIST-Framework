<h1>Enhancing Supply Chain Cybersecurity Using the NIST CSF</h1>

<h2>Description</h2>

Led a cybersecurity initiative for a large manufacturing organization to assess, secure, and build resilience across its global supply chain. I applied the NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF) to evaluate third-party risks, enforce vendor standards, and implement incident response strategies.

<h2>Key Contributions</h2>

### Supply Chain Risk Identification

- Mapped vendor ecosystem and categorized suppliers (Tier 1, Tier 2) by criticality and cyber exposure.<br>
- Built a Third-Party Risk Register tagging vendors as High, Medium, or Low risk.<br>
- Flagged vendors lacking certifications (SOC 2, ISO 27001) or security attestations.

### NIST CSF Risk Assessment 

- Performed risk-based vendor assessment across Identify, Protect, Detect, Respond, Recover.<br>
- Developed a Vendor Risk Matrix aligning vulnerabilities with NIST CSF functions.<br>
- Modeled business impact scenarios for threats like compromised firmware, weak encryption, and vendor impersonation.

### Vendor Cybersecurity Controls

- Authored Vendor Cybersecurity Guidelines aligned with NIST CSF.<br>
- Recommended controls: MFA, encryption, baseline configuration standards, log monitoring, anomaly detection, 24-hour breach notification.<br>
- Delivered a Vendor Cybersecurity Checklist incorporated into procurement contracts

### Monitoring & Incident Response

- Established continuous monitoring via third-party risk platform and threat intel feeds.<br>
- Designed a Supply Chain Cybersecurity Playbook.<br>
- Required vendor participation in tabletop exercises and continuity planning.
