<h1>Enhancing Cybersecurity for a Supply Chain Company Using the NIST CSF</h1>

<h2>Description</h2>
Led a cybersecurity initiative for a large manufacturing organization to assess, secure, and build resilience across its global supply chain. Using the NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF), I evaluated third-party risks, enforced vendor standards, and implemented incident response strategies.

<h2>Key Contributions</h2>

### Supply Chain Risk Identification

As part of supply chain risk identification, I mapped the vendor ecosystem, categorized Tier 1 and Tier 2 suppliers by criticality and exposure, and built a third-party risk register that classified vendors as high, medium, or low risk. I flagged suppliers that lacked certifications such as SOC 2 or ISO 27001 and documented gaps in their security attestations.

### NIST CSF Risk Assessment 

Using the NIST CSF, I conducted risk-based evaluations across the Identify, Protect, Detect, Respond, and Recover functions. I developed a vendor risk matrix aligning vulnerabilities with CSF functions and modeled business impact scenarios for threats including compromised firmware, weak encryption, and vendor impersonation.

### Vendor Cybersecurity Controls

I authored vendor cybersecurity guidelines aligned with NIST CSF and recommended controls such as multi-factor authentication, encryption, baseline configuration standards, log monitoring, anomaly detection, and a mandatory 24-hour breach notification requirement. I also delivered a vendor cybersecurity checklist that was formally embedded into procurement contracts.

### Monitoring & Incident Response

To strengthen monitoring and incident response, I established continuous oversight through a third-party risk management platform and integrated threat intelligence feeds. I designed a supply chain cybersecurity playbook and required vendors to participate in tabletop exercises and continuity planning.

### Outcome & Strategic Value

This initiative reduced third-party risk exposure by 40% within six months, reinforced compliance with NIST 800-161 and CMMC requirements, and embedded cybersecurity as a core criterion for vendor selection and contract renewals
